Title: Project #1 Part 1
Description: 

Design a Python class for a complex object (Dungeon) by making a list 
describing your design for your object that shows:

-A few components
-A few attributes for each component (variables)
-A few behaviors for each component (methods)
-The relationship between the components, attributes, and behaviors 
(perhaps with lines showing how a value would get used or calculated)


Character

    Attributes:
    -Name
    -Health
    -Inventory
    -Experience Points
    -Level

    Behaviors:
    - Move
    - Attack
    - Use Item
    - Level Up
    - Gain Experience

Objects

    Attributes:
    - Name
    - Description
    - Weight
    - Value
    
    Behaviors:
    - Pick Up
    - Drop
    - Examine
    - Use


World

    Attributes:
    - Map
    - Environmental Effects
    - Dungeon Theme
    - Difficulty Level
    
    Behaviors:
    - Generate Dungeon Layout
    - Set Environmental Effects
    - Change Theme
    - Adjust Difficulty

Monsters

    Attributes:
    - Name
    - Health
    - Attack Damage
    - Experience Points

    Behaviors:
    - Attack
    - Move
    - Calculate Experience Points
    - Drop Loot

Relationship Between Components, Attributes, and Behaviors:
- Character interacts with Objects by picking them up, using them, and dropping them.

- Character can move and attack within the World, and the World sets environmental 
effects and themes that affect the Character.

- Monsters exist within the World and can attack the Character, resulting in health 
changes and potential loot drops.

- Character gains experience points from defeating Monsters, which can lead to leveling
up and gaining new attributes.

- Objects, such as weapons or healing potions, can be found in the World and added 
to the Character's inventory, influencing their abilities and stats.
