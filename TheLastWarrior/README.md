(Watching for better examples for enemy movement)

Future Upgrades:
    1. Fix gameover menu(Some text not smooth and print test is failing for a single button press. Possible issue with loop/rendering/updating???) Maybe split it into different methods? 
    2. Fix enemy movement and spawning. Not happy with it. 
    3. Fix the back button highscore entry section of the gameover screen. (Possible path forward is known)
    4. Fix it so that the mouse doesn't change anything during the game. 
    4. Clean up code so it's more standard. 
    5. Create more tests. 

Future Future Upgrades:
    1. Have each character have their own style of attack
    2. Have settings (difficulty level, sounds, etc.)
    3. Have a pause game option which allows you to change settings or return to the menu. 
    4. have music switch between home, game play, and game over screens. 
    5. Make lives into a heart system and possible have a heart drop for every n number of enemies killed.
